Welcome to bouncy! However, you never do any of the bouncing.

Instead, every player has their own ball which will bounce around the screen, bouncing into their opponents' balls, walls and obstacles in the playing field.
As the balls bounce around the field, they will go over the tiles. If your cursor is in the same tile when your ball comes over it, you claim that tile.

Check out the other tabs for more information about the game.
