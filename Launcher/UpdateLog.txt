[0.8.0]
Massive (and i mean massive) rewrite and change of the whole app, basically built up from the ground up. 0.7.0 was original meant to contain new features (and change a majority of features), but i wanted to rework the networking which lead to most of the app breaking. So, i decided that a rewrite would be the best option to do. (110% worth it)

*ADDED*
- External links (Github, twitter, youtube, discord, itch.io)
- Offline ability (use the app offline with reduced functionality)
- Internet connectivity UI (Green = via wifi, orange = via data, red = none)
- Tooltip UI for some ui elements
- Version watermark (beta, alpha)
- More debug
- Comments to update log (quick note from me basically)
- Beta / alpha ui for easy changing between versions.
- Developer mode version. (Special limited version)
- Button to close app

*CHANGED*
House Style
- Background to a new background (Credit: me, better than solid colour)
- default background colour (gray with the image onto)
- Rewrote background message when loading
- background of menu
- colour of menu
- Made green brighter

Update log
- How Update log script is done (Splits data up, more checks)
- How update log looks (Instead of through the file into a scrollbar, split it up accordingly)
- How update log is stored in this file
- Update log error message
- How update log is retrieved (retrieved from storage instead of from server, if app hasn't changed view)

Functionality and other stuff
- How the app select menu worked
- Progress bar position + functionality
- Order of items in menu
- How installation of apps works (some verification)
- How the app checks for apps installed
- How networking is handled (Better request system, queue system, more progress feedback)
- Uninstall message (background, text)
- Unity version (2022 to 2023.1.0a14)


*FIXED*
- Issue where if one thing failed, everything would fail.
