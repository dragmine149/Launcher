You have just downloaded this new game onto your computer, the aim of the game is to cut down plants before they grow back, easy right?

BUT your computer has recent been infected with a virus, a virus which only happens when you "Play" the game. Why and How have unknown answers too. This virus, attempts to distract the user from playing the game.

Can you cut down all the plants in time? or will the virus stop you from playing?
